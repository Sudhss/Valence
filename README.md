## Valence 

Valence is an attemp to push my systems and backend limits, one step furthur
A code editor made from absolute scratch in C++, no monaco no fancy libraries, only logic and system designing concepts, 

Tech stack : C++, yes plain c++
no monaco or any predefined libraries, that's for rookies, real devs start from making a CPU first


Expected TOC : 20/5/26
