# Valence

Valence is an ongoing attempt to build a serious developer tool from first principles.

Not a clone.  
Not a demo.  
Not something rushed to look impressive.

Just a clean, desktop-first editor, and eventually a compiler, built to understand how modern tooling actually works under the hood.

This project is **in progress** and intentionally evolving.

## Tech stack 
- C++ (Yes, that's it, plain vanilla C++, what do you think? A system engineer relies on stupid libraries, nah we make them)
- Latest C++
- Cmake (i gotta run the project bro)
---

## Why Valence

Most tools are either:
- polished but opaque, or
- educational but impractical

Valence sits in between.

The goal is to build something usable while still staying close to the fundamentals — understanding *why* things work, not just making them work.

## What’s being built

### Valence Editor
A desktop code editor focused on correctness, simplicity, and restraint.

Planned direction:
- Native desktop application (Electron)
- Minimal UI with no visual noise
- A solid editing experience (indentation, brackets, syntax)
- Files, tabs, and workflows that feel predictable

No feature bloat.  
No premature abstraction.

---

### Valence Compiler (later)
A small compiler written in C++.

Scope is deliberately limited:
- A clean lexer → parser → semantic phase
- A minimal language with loops and functions
- Correctness over completeness

This is not about competing with existing compilers.
It’s about understanding them.

---

## Current state

Valence is under active development.

Things will break.  
Ideas will change.  
Commits may be uneven.

That’s expected.

---

## Principles

- Build slowly, but build properly  
- Prefer clear ideas over clever tricks  
- Learn by constructing, not copying  
- Keep the surface simple, let the depth grow  

---

## Status

🚧 Work in progress.  
No deadlines. No hype.

---

Valence is a long-term project.
